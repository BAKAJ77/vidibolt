# Vidibolt Core integration/staging tree (Archived)

## What is Vidibolt?
Vidibolt is a decentralised cryptocurrency network which aims to provide fast video streaming service to audiences in a distributed manner. 
Vidibolt makes use of peer-to-peer technology hence providing decentralisation since no central authority is needed. The blockchain
is used to store video data (streamed or not) and record transactions made using the Vidibolt currency, these transactions can range from tips to 
generic transfers between two people.

## Why is this archived?
I have been running low on time since I am currently in university and therefore struggle to find time to work on this while also focusing on my coursework
(which is quite tedious) so I have decided to archive this and leave it as so for the forseeable future, thanks.
